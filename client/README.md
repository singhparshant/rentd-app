# Frontend of the Rentd web application

To run the frontend locally on your computer, follow these steps:
1. Clone the project using git.
2. Change directory to the "client" subdirectory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
4. Run `npm start`. This will start a local server where you can interact with the frontend (the default port is 3000)
